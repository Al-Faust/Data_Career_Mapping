      <p class="lead"> We want to take a few moments of your time to show you opportunities for jobs all over the
        United States.<br>
        Primarily focusing on jobs within the Data World, specifically with Data Scientists, Data Analytics,
        Machine Learning Engineering and Data Engineering. We also will show the differences with pay, where the
        jobs are and what skills will be needed to get where you want to go. </p>

      <h5 class="card-title">The Skills</h5>
      <p class="card-text">When you are choosing a job, one of the most deciding factors will be the skills needed
        to excel. With the below graph you can see that SQL, Python and R are the top three skills required with
        SQL required over 50% of the time. While Python may be the second most asked for skill in today's job
        enviroment, it is a fairly common skill to have in your arsenal. Most companies require their candidates to know
        Python or R, but not necessarily both. Pay attention to where you are applying as well, as that will determine
        what languages are needed. </p>
